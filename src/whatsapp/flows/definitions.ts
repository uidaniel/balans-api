/**
 * The Flow JSON Balans publishes to Meta.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When a Flow, when a button, when a plain sentence
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A Flow is a form. It is the right shape when somebody has to hand over
 * several things they already know — their bank, their account number, their
 * email — and the only work is transcription. Six messages to collect four
 * facts is six chances to drift off, and every one of them is a chargeable
 * message from October 2026.
 *
 * It is the wrong shape for a decision. "Send it?" has three answers and needs
 * no form; three reply buttons are one tap where a Flow is a tap, a screen, a
 * choice and a submit.
 *
 * And it is emphatically wrong for the thing this product exists to do. The
 * promise is that you type "Invoice Tunde 20k for logo" and an invoice comes
 * back. Putting that behind a form with a client field, an amount field and a
 * date picker would rebuild exactly the app nobody wanted to open. The
 * conversation is the feature; the Flow is for the paperwork around it.
 *
 * So:
 *   - Flow    — onboarding, editing business details. Several known facts.
 *   - Buttons — a decision with up to three answers.
 *   - List    — a choice among four to ten fixed options.
 *   - Words   — anything that is the user's own expression of what they want.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The exception: an invoice with terms on it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * "Invoice Tunde 20k for logo" must never open a form, for the reason above.
 * But this arrived from a real user:
 *
 *   "Invoice daniel 250k for website development, it is project running from
 *    1st of october to like the 3rd week and there will be milestones,
 *    3 payment shared equally"
 *
 * The draft that came back had the whole sentence as its description, the
 * wrong date, and no milestones at all. Every correction is another sentence
 * to misread, so it stayed wrong.
 *
 * That is where a form earns its place — not as the front door, but as what
 * the front door falls back to. The invoice Flow below is never the first
 * thing anybody sees. It opens when somebody asks for it by name, or when
 * they are correcting a draft that has terms on it. Simple invoices, which
 * are most invoices, never meet it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why navigate rather than data_exchange
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A Flow can call our server between screens, which would let the bank
 * account be resolved and its name shown before the form closes. That needs a
 * published RSA key, signed request decryption and an endpoint Meta can reach,
 * and it buys one thing: confirming the account name inside the form instead
 * of in the chat a second later.
 *
 * The chat can do that confirmation with two buttons, which already work. So
 * these Flows are `navigate`: they collect, they close, and the verification
 * happens in the conversation where it is already understood.
